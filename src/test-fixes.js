// Sample screenplay for testing
const sampleScreenplay = `FADE IN:

INT. MAYA'S FLAT - NIGHT

A cozy but melancholic flat. Warm yellow lighting. MAYA (25), long brown hair, oversized grey hoodie, sits on the floor eating ice cream from a tub.

MAYA
(to herself)
He wasn't even cute enough to cry over.

She opens her phone, swipes through the dating app "SWYPR". Photos of men flash by - left swipe, left swipe, left swipe.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Next. Next. Next.

CUT TO:

DIGITAL REALM - CONTINUOUS

Maya finds herself standing on a glass floor in a surreal, futuristic space. A godlike, humanoid figure approaches - KODEX, the sentient AI.

KODEX
(calm, robotic voice)
Their data... dissolved.

FADE OUT.

THE END`;
